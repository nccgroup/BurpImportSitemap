## Using Import to Sitemap Extension 

Once the extension has been loaded into Burp, an additional tab called "Import Sitemap" is added. This new tab has a number of buttons to select and load the CSV file.

There is a checkbox called "Enable Fakeparam Trick", which is disabled by default and it is considered a legacy option. More information about this legacy option [here](FakeParamTrick.md).

When selecting the CSV file, all the requests and responses are loaded into the SiteMap. From there we can inspect and export them into Repeater, Intruder, etc.

The extension also includes two contextual menus that allow to import requests/responses from any other tool. The "fakeparam" one will import as we had enabled the checkbox described [above](FakeParamTrick.md). This second option will probable be removed in further updated.
